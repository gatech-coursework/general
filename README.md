## Advising

OMS CS ADVISING EMAIL ADDRESS (oms-advising@cc.gatech.edu):  

* All OMS CS students should send a message to oms-advising@cc.gatech.edu when they have advising-related questions.
* Please include your full name and nine-digit GT ID number (90X-XX-XXXX) in EVERY email. 
* Please do not copy multiple people and/or send the same email to multiple people.  When you email oms-advising@cc.gatech.edu, you will receive a ticket number.  This is your confirmation that we have received your message.
* Please note that when we respond to your email, you will receive two emails:  one with our response and the other stating that your ticket has been resolved.  You should receive our response first; however, if you receive the "resolved ticket" message first, please be patient, as the response email should arrive soon.  Please check to ensure it did not go to another folder (like spam) before emailing us to say that you did not receive a response.  Your patience with this is greatly appreciated.
* If you have further questions after we answer your email (close your ticket), you MUST open a new ticket by sending a new, separate email to oms-advising@cc.gatech.edu (including your full name and GT ID number).  If you reply to our response, there is a good chance you will not receive a reply because these messages are not always directed back to the oms-advising@cc.gatech.edu account.  To ensure your email is received, please send a new email every time you have a question.
